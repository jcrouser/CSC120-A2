What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was very hard for me. I don't even know how to explain it if I'm being honest. I got an extension and it is taking me so long to figure this out and it won't even work despite hours of trying and now I'm submitting it a few minutes late. I don't even know how to fix this, the errors make no sense.
